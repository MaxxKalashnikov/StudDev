This was my first big project on C#. It is the managing application for university called "StudDec". The idea was to creat an application which would help teachers and administration stuff 
to deal with all information of students (name, date of birth, adress, etc.). I made a big work dealing with all databases and local server. I added many features which allow the user to work
with database tables, add them, change them and other necessary operations. I also added logging in feature and feature which allows the user to change the password or, 
if the user forgot it, made a new one. THere are still a lot things to work and improve but it gives a view on my programming skills.

If you have any questions do not hesitate to text me on my e-mail.
