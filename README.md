Attention! Very raw product!

This was my first big project on C#. It is the managing application for university called "StudDec". The idea was to create a desktop application which would help teachers and administration stuff 
to deal with all information of students (name, ID, date of birth, adress, etc.). I made a big work dealing with all databases and local server. I added many features which allow the user to work
with database tables, add them, change them and other necessary operations. 

I also added logging in and signing in feature and feature which allows the user to change the password or, if the user forgot it, make a new one. Because I did not really have a penny for this project, I used Microsoft Access as my database engine and a simple local server for logging-signing in process. There are still just plenty of things which need to be redone or replaced, but it's completely working product, just need to set it up correctly.

If you have any questions do not hesitate to text me on my e-mail.
